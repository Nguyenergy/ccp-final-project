This Calorie Tracker project is a simple and interactive C++ program that lets users keep track of their meals and how many calories they’ve eaten. It starts by asking for the user’s name, then provides a menu with options to log a meal, view the calorie log, or clear the log entirely. All the data is saved in a text file based on the user’s name, so they can come back and check it later. The project uses basic C++ features like functions, file handling, strings, if-else statements, loops, and input validation to make sure everything runs smoothly. The code is split into different files to keep things organized. To run it in CodeSpaces, just compile it with g++ main.cpp functions.cpp -o tracker in the terminal, then type ./tracker to launch the program. It's a great example of using C++ to build something practical and user-friendly.
